#  Server Dumps

 This repository contains logs extracted from the corporate servers. Your goal is to analyze the data and reconstruct the events surrounding the treasury system.

## Files

- **system_events.log**  
  Time-stamped records of server activity. Look for unusual actions, file deletions, or system alerts.

- **vault_access.log**  
  Shows who attempted to access the treasury system. Only certain users or systems are authorized. Pay attention to successful and denied attempts.

## Guidance

1. Compare timestamps across the logs to find correlations between events.  
2. Identify which systems/users have legitimate access and which attempts were denied.  
3. Look for anomalies — any action that seems out of sequence or unexpected may indicate unauthorized activity.  

Good luck — careful observation is key!
